Storage Engine is like a plugin.

Storage Engine:
    MMAP
        Default

    Wired Tiger
        2014

Quiz: Storage Engines: Introduction
The storage engine directly determines which of the following?
Check all that apply.
a. The data file format
b. The wire protocol for the drivers
c. Format of indexes
d. Architecture of a cluster

Answer: a and c

by command line:

man mmap

then, the system shows:

MMAP(2)                     BSD System Calls Manual                    MMAP(2)

NAME
     mmap -- allocate memory, or map files or devices into memory

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/mman.h>

     void *
     mmap(void *addr, size_t len, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);

DESCRIPTION
     The mmap() system call causes the pages starting at addr and continuing for at most len bytes to be mapped from the object described by fd, starting
     at byte offset offset.  If offset or len is not a multiple of the pagesize, the mapped region may extend past the specified range.  Any extension
     beyond the end of the mapped object will be zero-filled.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In fact, the minimum record space in MongoDB 3.0 is 32 bytes.

MMAP uses a cache system called Virtual Memory

1.  Collection Level Locking
2.  In Place Updates
3.  Power of Two Sizes

#Quiz: Storage Engines: MMAPv1
#Which of the following statements about the MMAPv1 storage engine are true?
#Check all that apply.
a. MMAPv1 offers document-level locking
b. MMAPv1 automatically allocates power-of-two-sized documents when new documents are inserted
c. MMAPv1 is built on top of the mmap system call that maps files into memory
d. MongoDB manages the memory used by each mapped file, deciding which parts to swap to disk.

Answer: b and c

The correct answers are:

MMAPv1 automatically allocates power-of-two-sized documents when new documents are inserted
This is handled by the storage engine.
MMAPv1 is built on top of the mmap system call that maps files into memory
This is the basic idea behind why we call it MMAPv1.
Wrong ones are:

MMAPv1 offers document-level locking
It has collection level locking.
MongoDB manages the memory used by each mapped file, deciding which parts to swap to disk.
The operating system handles this.

In this lecture, Andrew uses a single '-' to invoke arguments to the mongod process. While this works, the preferred syntax uses two dashes, so, for example, to invoke a WiredTiger storage engine, you would use:
mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger

1.  Document Level Concurrency
2.  Compression of data
    Compression of indexes
3.  No Inplace Update

killall mongod
mkdir WT
mongod -dbpath WT -storageEngine wiredTiger

then you insert a doc in any collection then you type:
db.mycollection.stats();
.
.
.
.
    "wiredTiger" : {
        "metadata" : {
                "formatVersion" : 1
        },
        "creationString" : {...}
    }
