**********************
**********************  Sparse Indexes
**********************

Docs of collection mycollection:

{a:1,  b:2, c:5}
{a:10, b:5, c:10}
{a:13, b:17}
{a:7,  b:23}

There is not problem create an index for:
a and b fields, because each value in each doc is unique.

But there is a problem if you create an index for c field, because the last 2 docs has null value for c field.

so,

db.mycollection.createIndex({c:1}, {unique: true});
shows the error:
duplicated null value.


db.mycollection.createIndex({c:1}, {unique: true, sparse: true});
this creates the index without problems

db.mycollection.sort({a:-1});


#Quiz: Index Creation, Sparse
#What are the advantages of a sparse index? Check all that apply.
a. The index will be smaller than it would if it were not sparse.
b. The index can be used to sort much more quickly in all cases.
c. You can gain greater flexibility with creating Unique indexes.
d. Your indexes can be multikey only if they are sparse.
Answer: a and c

**********************  Index Creation Background
**********************

Index Creation:

Foreground                      Background
----------                      ----------
 default
 fast                            slow
 Blocks reads and writes         Do not Blocks reads and writes


While the index is created the mongodb blocks the collection, so you can not run a find on that collection.
And the creation on the index could take some time, and it depends on the number of docs in the collection.



Let's drop the index and then create again the index in background:

> db.students.dropIndex({'scores.score':1});
{ "nIndexesWas" : 2, "ok" : 1 }

> db.students.createIndex({'scores.score':1}, {background: true});
{
	"createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,
	"numIndexesBefore" : 1,
	"numIndexesAfter" : 2,
	"ok" : 1
}

So, you can run a find on that collection, it will not be block for readers!!!!!!!!


#Quiz: Index Creation, Background
#Which things are true about creating an index in the background in MongoDB. Check all that apply.
a. A mongod instance can only build one background index at a time per database.
b. Although the database server will continue to take requests, a background index creation still blocks the mongo shell that you are using to create the index.
c. Creating an index in the background takes longer than creating it in the foreground
d. In Mongo 2.2 and above, indexes are created in the background by default.
Answer: b and c
