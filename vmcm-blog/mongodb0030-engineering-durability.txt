*************************   Write Concern
*************************


An update or insert to mongoDB is really an update or insert in memory, then, the journal writes the update or insert on disk periodically.
So,
    if the app receives w=1, means the update was done on memory.
    if the app receives j=true, means the update was done on disk.

By default the app receives w=1, so it is really fast, because if the app wait for j=true it will be slower, maybe 100 or 1000 times.

If the server writes on memory, then the app receives w=1, then the server crash, so the data is lost.



W   |    j
------------
1   |   false        Fast, small window of vulnerability.   DEFAULT
1   |   true         Slow
0   |   unack


Quiz: Write Concern

Provided you assume that the disk is persistent, what are the w and j settings required to guarantee that an insert or update has been written all the way to disk.

w=0, j=0
w=1, j=1
w=2, j=0
w=1, j=0

Answer: w=1, j=1

            insert
App --------------------->   Mongo
            Error
    <---------------------

In this case we don not know if the insert was or not successful!


Quiz: Network Errors

What are the reasons why an application may receive an error back even if the write was successful. Check all that apply.

1. The network TCP connection between the application and the server was reset after the server received a write but before a response could be sent.
2. The MongoDB server terminates between receiving the write and responding to it.
3. The network fails between the time of the write and the time the client receives a response to the write.
4. The write violates a primary key constraint on the collection.

Answer: 1, 2 and 3
