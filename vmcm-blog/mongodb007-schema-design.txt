#Quiz: MongoDB Schema Design
----------------------------
What's the single most important factor in designing your application schema within MongoDB?
Answer:
Matching the data access patterns of your application.

Blog schema design:
------------------
collection:
post
{
    "_id" : "",
    "author" : "",
    "body" : "",
    "comments" : [
                    {
                        "body" : ""
                        "email" : ""
                        "author" : ""
                    },{
                        "body" : ""
                        "email" : ""
                        "author" : ""
                    }
    ],
    "date" : "",
    "permalink" : "",
    "tags" : [
        "cycling",
        "mongodb",
        "swimming"
    ],
    "title" : ""
}
#Quiz: Mongo Design for Blog
Which data access pattern is not well supported by the blog schema?
a. Collecting the most recent blog entries for the blog home page
b. Collecting all the information to display a single post
c. Collecting all comments by a single author
d. Providing a table of contents by tag
Answer: d


Alternative design for Blog:
---------------------------

Collection  Collection      Collection
Post        Comments        Tags
-_id        -id             -id
-title      -postId         -tag
-body       -author         -postId
-author     -email
-date       -order
This design does not work particularly well, although it might seem the most natural comming from the relational world.

!Always try to embed data where you can, prejoin it where you can.!

Living without constraints
--------------------------
    How do you live without foreign key constraints and keep your data consistent?
        In particular embedding actually helps, so the first design is particularly a good one. (the one with one collection named post)

#Quiz: Living Without Constraints
What does Living Without Constraints refer to?
a. Living every day like it's your last
b. Saying whatever you want when you want it
c. Keeping your data consistent even though MongoDB lacks foreign key constraints
d. Wearing no belt
Answer: c

Living without transactions
---------------------------

Mongo DB does not have:
    Transactions: ACID Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Mongo DB has:
    Atomic Operations
        When you work on a single doc that work will be completed before anyone else sees the doc.

1.  Restructure your code
        You are working on a single doc and taking advantage of the atomic operations within a doc

2.  Implement in software
        Implements some sort of locking in software.

3.  Tolerate a little bit of inconsistency

#Quiz: Living Without Transactions
Which of the following operations operate atomically within a single document? Check all that apply
a. Update
b. findAndModify
c. $addToSet (within an update)
d. $push within an update
Answer: a, b, c, d
