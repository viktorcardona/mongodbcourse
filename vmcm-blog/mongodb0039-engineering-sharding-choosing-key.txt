    - Sufficient Cardinality
    - Avoid Hot Spotting in writes (monotonically increasing)
    - Shard key can not have multi-key index, so it is illegal an array as a shard key

Quiz: Choosing a Shard Key

You are building a facebook competitor called footbook that will be a mobile social network of feet. You have decided that your primary data structure for posts to the wall will look like this:
{'username':'toeguy',
     'posttime':ISODate("2012-12-02T23:12:23Z"),
     "randomthought": "I am looking at my feet right now",
     'visible_to':['friends','family', 'walkers']}
Thinking about the tradeoffs of shard key selection, select the true statements below.

1. Choosing posttime as the shard key will cause hotspotting as time progresses.
2. Choosing username as the shard key will distribute posts to the wall well across the shards.
3. Choosing visible_to as a shard key is illegal.
4. Choosing posttime as the shard key suffers from low cardinality.

Answer: 1, 2 and 3
