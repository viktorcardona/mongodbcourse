Lecture Notes

One thing to remember is that the driver will check, upon attempting to write, whether or not its write concern is valid.
It will error if, for example, w=4 but there are 3 data-bearing replica set members.
This will happen quickly in both the Java and pymongo drivers.
Reading with an invalid readPreference will take longer, but will also result in an error.
Be aware, though, that this behavior can vary a little between drivers and between versions.


    -   Seed Lists          Members of the replica set
    -   Write Concern       w=number of nodes to wait that acknowledge the writes, j=wait or not the write is done on disk of the primary, wtimeout=time to wait ack
    -   Read Preferences    primeary by default
    -   Errors can happen


Quiz: Review of Implications of Replication

If you set w=4 on a MongoClient and there are only three nodes in the replica set, how long will you wait in PyMongo for a response from an insert if you don't set a timeout?
