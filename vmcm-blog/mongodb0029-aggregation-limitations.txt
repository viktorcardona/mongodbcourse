*************************   Limitations in Aggregation Framework
*************************


*   100 MB limit for pipeline stages
    they come back if the query is large

    allow DiskUse parameter for not limited

*   16 MB limit by default

    set cursor in this case

*   sharder system  ->  group by or sort then result is sent to primary shard
    so it does not have the same level of scalability in aggregation that you can find in hadoop
    is not quit good performance

    s0  s1  s2  s3  s4

    Alternative:
        Hadoop - map/reduce (hadoop connector)
        but map/reduce is not recommended in mongoDB, aggregation is better choice
