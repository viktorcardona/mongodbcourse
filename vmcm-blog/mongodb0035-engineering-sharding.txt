*************************

Sharding is a method for storing data across multiple machines.
MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.

To address these issues of scales, database systems have two basic approaches: vertical scaling and sharding.

Vertical scaling
------------------
    Adds more CPU and storage resources to increase capacity. Scaling by adding capacity has limitations: high performance systems with large numbers of CPUs and large amount of RAM are disproportionately more expensive than smaller systems. Additionally, cloud-based providers may only allow users to provision smaller instances. As a result there is a practical maximum capability for vertical scaling.

Sharding
----------
    Horizontal scaling, by contrast, divides the data set and distributes the data over multiple servers, or shards. Each shard is an independent database, and collectively, the shards make up a single logical database.


For more information, see the documentation at http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/sharding-introduction/

Shards is configured on a Replica Set.

Shards store the data.
To provide high availability and data consistency, in a production sharded cluster, each shard is a replica set.

Shard Keys
------------

To shard a collection, you need to select a shard key.
A shard key is either an indexed field or an indexed compound field that exists in every document in the collection. MongoDB divides the shard key values into chunks and distributes the chunks evenly across the shards. To divide the shard key values into chunks, MongoDB uses either range based partitioning or hash based partitioning.

MongoS
--------

Interface with client applications and direct operations to the appropriate shard or shards
MongoS is the router, whe we send a query the mongoS define to wich shard should redirect the quesry based on the shard key of the documents.

From a shell, we also talk to the mongoS, in order to work with the shards.
